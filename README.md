Pixel Buddy üêæ

Pixel Buddy is a simple virtual pet game where you take care of a pixelated pet. You need to feed, play with, and heal your buddy to keep it happy, healthy, and alive!
Features

    Hunger, Happiness, and Health stats dynamically updated
    Interactive buttons to feed, play, and heal your pet
    Visual indicators: text color changes based on the pet's state (normal, warning, critical)

How to Play

    Feed: Increases hunger, but reduces happiness and health.
    Play: Increases happiness, but decreases hunger and health.
    Heal: Increases health, but decreases hunger and happiness.

Be careful! If any of the stats (hunger, happiness, or health) reach zero, your Pixel Buddy will die. Try to maintain a balanced state!
