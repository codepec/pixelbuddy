# Pixel Buddy üêæ

Pixel Buddy is a simple virtual pet game where you take care of a pixelated pet. You need to feed, play with, and heal your buddy to keep it happy, healthy, and alive!

## Features

* Hunger, Happiness, and Health stats dynamically updated
* Interactive buttons to feed, play, and heal your pet
* Visual indicators: text color changes based on the pet's state (normal, warning, critical)

## How to Play

* Feed: Increases hunger, but reduces happiness and health.
* Play: Increases happiness, but decreases hunger and health.
* Heal: Increases health, but decreases hunger and happiness.

Be careful! If any of the stats (hunger, happiness, or health) reach zero, your Pixel Buddy will die. Try to maintain a balanced state!
